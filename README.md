### Part 1: Scenario - Procurement & Project Management (20 Minutes)

**Context:** The Data Analytics Hub has identified a critical new AI foundational model that is essential for a new strategic project. The free trial for this model ends in 14 days, and the team needs it fully procured and operational within 8 weeks. This is a new contract with an international vendor, and the total cost will require a formal tender process.

**Your Task:** Outline the high-level project plan you would create to manage this process.

In your answer, cover the following:

* **Key Steps:** What are the 5-7 most critical steps you would take, from initiation to completion?
*7 Steps: Initiate the project , check if all conceptual design approvals has been followed through for stage gate, , detailed design final approvals, following through to exceution and close out and completetion and do a benefit review.

  Control: Monitor the contract in the excecuition phase , through monthly performance management 
   
* **Stakeholders:** Who are the key departments (e.g., Legal, SCM, etc.) you would need to liaise with, and why?
* Legal - To draft the MOA between the supplier and the city of cape town , SCM to following through with the PO , do the agreement number , generate the requistion , align the budget 
* **Immediate Risks:** What are the top 3 risks you would immediately flag to the Manager of the Data Analytics Hub?
1.	Stakeholder Analysis using PPM & CRMS: First, I would use the Project Portfolio Management (PPM) system and Customer Relationship Management Systems (CRMS) to identify all project stakeholders and their roles. This ensures no key department or individual is missed.
2.	MFMA-Compliant Justification: To build buy-in, I would help articulate how the new data tool will lead to better financial management in SAP (e.g., more accurate capital budget allocation) or optimize operations, similar to how the SCOOT system improved traffic flow. This links the project directly to the SDBIP targets.
